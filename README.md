# PetStore Swagger Exercise #

For trying my hand back in JS w/ api testing and such.

## Test Docker Vulnerabilities ##

```bash
git clone https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security.git
cd docker-bench-security
sudo sh docker-bench-security.sh
```

## Run Test in Docker Container ##

Container will run the npm start item in package.json

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Note ##

In order for this to run correctly a configuration file needs to supply secure information to the scripts. Please contact the creator for details on how to get that setup appropriately.
